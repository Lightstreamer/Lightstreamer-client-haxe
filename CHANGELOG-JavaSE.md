# Lightstreamer Java SE Client Changelog

## Unreleased

Updated the library haxe-concurrent to version 5.1.3.


## 5.0.0-beta.2
*Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.3.2*<br/>
*Not compatible with code developed with the previous version.*<br/>
*Made available on 5 Apr 2023* 

Rewritten the function to decode the percent encoded messages sent by the Server so that it has the same behavior on all the targets.

Suppressed the unsolicited console outputs produced by the library.


## 5.0.0-beta.1
*Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.3.2*<br/>
*Not compatible with code developed with the previous version.*<br/>
*Made available on 16 Mar 2023* 

Rewritten the whole Client SDK in the cross-platform programming language Haxe, which allows to share the core features with the other Client SDKs and at the same time to add functionalities specific to this platform.<br>
The old library is still available [here](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-lib-client-java).

Improved the "delta delivery" mechanism, by adding the support for value differences, as per the extension introduced in Server version 7.3.0.
Currently two "diff" formats are supported: JSON Patch and TLCP-diff.

Added the getValueAsJSONPatchIfAvailable function in the ItemUpdate class, to take advantage of the new support for JSON Patch differences, which may prove useful in some use cases.
See the Docs for details.

Added the new error code 70 to the interface method `ClientListener.onServerError`, to report that an unusable port was configured on the server address.
Previously a similar case was treated as a request syntax error.

The logging facilities have been revised in order to expose the same API on all supported platforms.<br/>
They consist of:

- the Logger and LoggerProvider interfaces
- the off-the-shelf ConsoleLoggerProvider class, which prints messages to the standard output when passed to the method `LightstreamerClient.setLoggerProvider(LoggerProvider)`.

The logging methods `fatal(String)`, `error(String)`, `warn(String)`, `info(String)` and `debug(String)` have been removed from the Logger interface.

The following properties have been changed:

- `Subscription.getItems`
- `Subscription.getItemGroup`
- `Subscription.getFields`
- `Subscription.getFieldSchema`
- `Subscription.getCommandSecondLevelFields`
- `Subscription.getCommandSecondLevelFieldSchema`

Now they return null when the values are not available. 
Previously they threw an IllegalStateException.

The following obsolete methods have been removed:

- `ConnectionOptions.getConnectTimeout`
- `ConnectionOptions.setConnectTimeout`
- `ConnectionOptions.getCurrentConnectTimeout`
- `ConnectionOptions.setCurrentConnectTimeout`
- `ConnectionOptions.isEarlyWSOpenEnabled`
- `ConnectionOptions.setEarlyWSOpenEnabled`

The signatures of the following methods have been changed:

- `ClientListener.onListenStart` and `ClientListener.onListendEnd`: removed the parameter of type LightstreamerClient
- `SubscriptionListener.onListenStart` and `SubscriptionListener.onListendEnd`: removed the parameter of type Subscription

The system property `com.lightstreamer.client.session.thread`, which instructed the library to use a dedicated thread for each LightstreamerClient instance, is not supported anymore.
